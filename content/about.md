Thanks for spending some time on theMacAdmins Blog! My name is Ed Shorrock, and I run the site. I live just north of Columbus Ohio with my wife, daughter and our two dogs. I am an engineer for Cardinal Health working on technologies such as:

- Apple Devices
- iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS
- Mobile Device Management
- App Publishing for Apple, Microsoft and Android stores
- Special Platforms

In my spare time I enjoy things regular people seem to enjoy like, cooking and spending time outside with my family and dogs.
