We do not collect or store your data. Ever.

This is a static site run out of a Google Data bucket. We have no database or other functionality to store your information. That is on purpose. We believe that personal privacy starts and ends with personal data. To that end, your personal data will always stay where it should. With you.

If you have any questions about this policy please email us at thatMacAdmin@macbytes.io.
